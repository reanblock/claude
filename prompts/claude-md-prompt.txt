Analyze this codebase and create a CLAUDE.md file following these principles:

1. Keep it under 150 lines total - focus only on universally applicable information
2. Cover the essentials: WHAT (tech stack, project structure), WHY (purpose), and HOW (build/test commands)
3. Use Progressive Disclosure: instead of including all instructions, create a brief index pointing to other markdown files in .claude/docs/ for specialized topics
4. Include file:line references instead of code snippets
5. Assume I'll use linters for code style - don't include formatting guidelines

Structure it as: project overview, tech stack, key directories/their purposes, essential build/test commands, and a list of additional documentation files Claude should check when relevant.
