# Claude

## Basics

Below are some basics such as getting started, installation, CLI reference, different modes, and initiating a project.

- CLI reference [here](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference)
- Plan Mode (shift+tab) [here](https://claudelog.com/mechanics/plan-mode/)
- Interactive Mode [here](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode#general-controls)
- Checkpointing [here](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/checkpointing)
- Use `plan` mode when starting new projects (toggle using tab+shift)
- Create a CLAUDE.md (and associated) files for context loading. Use [this prompt](./prompts/claude-md-prompt.txt).

## Commands

These are custom commands that are explicity invoked using `/`. For example, [here](./commands/explore.md) is a custom `/explore` command which can be used to explore a new repo.
