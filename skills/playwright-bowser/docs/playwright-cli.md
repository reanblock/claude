Playwright CLI with SKILLS

### Playwright CLI vs Playwright MCP

[Permalink: Playwright CLI vs Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#playwright-cli-vs-playwright-mcp)

This package provides CLI interface into Playwright. If you are using **coding agents**, that is the best fit.

- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.

- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns. Learn more about [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).


### Key Features

[Permalink: Key Features](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#key-features)

- **Token-efficient**. Does not force page data into LLM.

### Requirements

[Permalink: Requirements](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#requirements)

- Node.js 18 or newer
- Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any other coding agent.

## Getting Started

[Permalink: Getting Started](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#getting-started)

## Installation

[Permalink: Installation](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#installation)

```
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --help
```

### Installing skills

[Permalink: Installing skills](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#installing-skills)

Claude Code, GitHub Copilot and others will use the locally installed skills.

```
playwright-cli install --skills
```

### Skills-less operation

[Permalink: Skills-less operation](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#skills-less-operation)

Point your agent at the CLI and let it cook. It'll read the skill off `playwright-cli --help` on its own:

```
Test the "add todo" flow on https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc using playwright-cli.
Check playwright-cli --help for available commands.
```

## Demo

[Permalink: Demo](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#demo)

```
> Use playwright skills to test https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/.
  Take screenshots for all successful and failing scenarios.
```

Your agent will be running commands, but it does not mean you can't play with it manually:

```
playwright-cli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/ --headed
playwright-cli type "Buy groceries"
playwright-cli press Enter
playwright-cli type "Water flowers"
playwright-cli press Enter
playwright-cli check e21
playwright-cli check e35
playwright-cli screenshot
```

## Headed operation

[Permalink: Headed operation](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#headed-operation)

Playwright CLI is headless by default. If you'd like to see the browser, pass `--headed` to `open`:

```
playwright-cli open https://playwright.dev --headed
```

## Sessions

[Permalink: Sessions](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#sessions)

Playwright CLI will use a dedicated persistent profile by default. It means that
your cookies and other storage state will be preserved between the calls. You can use different
instances of the browser for different projects with sessions.

Following will result in two browsers with separate profiles being available. Pass `-s=` to
the invocation to talk to a specific browser.

```
playwright-cli open https://playwright.dev
playwright-cli -s=example open https://example.com
playwright-cli list
```

You can run your coding agent with the `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION` environment variable:

```
PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo-app claude .
```

Or instruct it to prepend `-s=` to the calls.

Manage your sessions as follows:

```
playwright-cli list                     # list all sessions
playwright-cli close-all                # close all browsers
playwright-cli kill-all                 # forcefully kill all browser processes
```

## Configuration file

[Permalink: Configuration file](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli#configuration-file)

The Playwright CLI can be configured using a JSON configuration file. You can specify the configuration file using the `--config` command line option:

```
playwright-cli --config path/to/config.json open example.com
```

Playwright CLI will load config from `playwright-cli.json` by default so that you did not need to specify it every time.
