# Skills

Skills are markdown files that provide Claude a set of instructions to perform a specific task. You can get Claude to create a new skill by simply asking it to! Remember to ask the question "What else should I clarify?" after sharing all the details about your new skill.

**NOTE**: Claude Desktop ships with the `skill-creator` skill enabled (under Settings -> Capabilities -> Skills).

The skill must be placed in the following folder structure: `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.

## Install


Use [skills.sh](https://skills.sh/) and then follow instructions.

For example:

```bash
npx skills add anthropics/skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills
```

**NOTE**: When installing skills vua `npx skills` it will install in the `.agents/skills` folder and creates a symlink from the `.claude/skills` folder so that Claude can detect it.

## Create Skill

You can also create your own custom skills using `npx sills`. For details run `npx skills --help` and check this tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcRS8-7OgBo&t=581s).
