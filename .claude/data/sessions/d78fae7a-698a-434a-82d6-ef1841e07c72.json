If you have any questions about this skill please ask.\n\n# Client Audit Scoping Skill\n\nThis skill needs to be for taking a and reviewing a new codebase for the purpose of performing an audit on that code base. There will be an input required for this skill which will be a comma separated list. List of files that are in scope\n\n## Details\n\nInclude some minor feedback to the BD lead, such as:\n\n- A mini-summary for all audits, including noteworthy aspects/integrations of the codebase\n- If the test quality is not good, explain why (e.g. tests are failing, or how they could prepare better tests before the audit)\n- If code comments are lacking, or especially if the documentation is not sufficient, point that out\n- If the protocol interacts with other vaults/pools, highlight that so we know which areas to focus on during the audit\n- Note any positive points about what the customer is doing well\n\nThe above are just examples BD has received in the past and were very helpful! Basically, the goal is to note:\n\n- General feedback\n- Recommendations and advice to help the customer prepare for the audit so it can be conducted smoothly\n- Comments on positive aspects (to show we understand and appreciate what they are doing well)\n\n## Tools\n\nUse `cloc` or `scc` to get the LoC of the contracts in scope.\n\n## Tests\n\nTry to run the project tests using the testing tools specified in the project (hardhat, foundry).\n\n## Scope\n\nProvide a summary as follows along with any feedback, LoC details, test run summary (just the final tests pass / fail count) and other relevent information useful for scoping the audit.\n\n```\nDocs Quality:     [High|Med|Low]\nTest Quality:     [High|Med|Low]\nRamp Up:                 N h / auditor  \nAudit:                     N LoC / 100 = N hours / auditor\nReport:                 N h\nCommunication:     N h / auditor\nFix Review:         N h / auditor  \n```\n\n## Definitions\n\nNote in the above table \"N h\" means N number of hours like 5 h is five hours for example. \n\n\"Docs Quality\" can be based on what you find availble in this repo or online for this project.\n\n\"Test Quality\" is based on the test run. If all pass and there is good coverage then it is High. If no tests then Low.\n\n\"Ramp Up\" is usually a percentage of the number of hours for the total audit. Can be about 5% to 10% depending on on the complexity of the code base. \n\n\"Audit\" hours is calculated based on number of lines of code (LoC), usually divided by 100, to get the hours but if there is some complexity like complex math or some strange or new techniques or libraries that are used or assembly or anything like that then we can add a multiplier to that so it's not just divided by 100, but there's a multiplier applied to it based on complexity. \n\n\"Report\" time depends on the size of the audit, can be approximately 10% to 15% of the \"Audit\" time. \n\n\"Communication\" is the amount of time an auditor needs to spend with the client. Usually it's low, about one hour or so, but again depending on the complexity, this might need to increase and same with \n\n\"Fix Review\" the fixed review is dependent on the size of the audit itself usually around five to ten percent of the audit time."
